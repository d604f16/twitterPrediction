63;Ocramius;@kalessil `require 'filename.php'` - no vars, constant value, no __DIR__, non-absolute path;Deutschland;
64;Ocramius;@harikt that is a separate concern. Any API backend can "forget" the validator (bug) /cc @xtreamwayz @dantleech @Sulu_io;Deutschland;
65;Ocramius;@harikt could you elaborate on "easy to guess the input"? This component extracts a validator from XML/HTML @xtreamwayz @dantleech @Sulu_io;Deutschland;
66;Ocramius;.@kalessil one suggestion for EA inspections: mark includes without an absolute constant path (they would hit include_path) /cc @phpstorm;Deutschland;
67;Ocramius;@matthieunapoli a wrapper usually wraps around public API to fake something. As soon as a method is inherited, that is broken;Deutschland;
68;Ocramius;"Ah, it's in French... So that's why it doesn't exist...";Deutschland;

2333;ceejbot;Hmm, if you were going to JSConf Iceland, what would you want to hear about? Mulling over writing talk proposal!;CA;
2337;izs;@DeirdreS oh for sure. I think radicalism kinda requires giving a lot of a certain kind of fuck tho.;CA;
2338;izs;This is the first time someone is near to being on the ballot who actually seems to have "don't kill people" as a priority. So I'm excited.;CA;
2339;izs;Basically, every four years, I try to vote for whichever sociopath will use the most powerful weapons in history to kill the fewest people.;CA;
2340;izs;@goofbone oh lol, didn't realize you were chiming in, took it as a debate sry my bad :);CA;
2341;izs;The flip side, Feminister Than Thou, is also hella tedious though. There are good reasons many young feminists prefer Bernie.;CA;
2342;izs;And, yeah, the Great White Liberal Educator complex is real and annoying. There are reasons some smart well-informed folks prefer Hillary.;CA;
2343;izs;@goofbone I did. And I'm convinced that Hillary and Bernie will be identical in their view on that. So no point discussing.;CA;
2344;izs;Meanwhile, HRC is all "all lives matter" and afaik still has not really addressed police violence except to change the subject to terrorism.;CA;
2345;izs;And, let's not forget, Bernie got heckled to shit by BLM, and *actually addressed the issue*, which is sadly pretty much unheard of;CA;
2346;izs;@scripterson @mikeal @dominictarr No.;CA;
2347;izs;All things being equal? Yeah, I think it's high time for a woman president.But the things, they ain't equal.;CA;
2348;izs;Only Bernie has made spoken out about free education, wealth disparity, and health care a core part of his platform.;CA;
2349;izs;Only Bernie has said he's going to actively reduce the footprint of the American military empire.;CA;
2350;izs;Both Bernie and Hillary will fight for health care, lgbt rights, and the basic "table stakes" progressivism.  So what?;CA;
2351;izs;It's great HRC is experienced, can "get stuff done". But does that "stuff" involve reducing the number of people killed by the US? Doubtful.;CA;
2352;izs;Here's the thing: I am a single issue voter. My single issue is that the govt should help people, not kill them. https://t.co/MwdNXIqBIn;CA;
2353;izs;@DeirdreS I don't know that that's really borne out by evidence. Yes, women get shit on more as they age, but more radical? Doesn't seem so.;CA;

22726;bmann;@Network_Guy @oldgravy that is the “market knows best” view - I suspect Euro-roots @mor10 &amp. me prefer regulatory input;Vancouver;

24841;buzz;@harryh Specifically referring to a moment where Frost gets Nixon to say "It's legal because the President says it's legal.";NY;
24842;buzz;@harryh Oh yeah it's great!;NY;
24843;buzz;@harryh Yeah, funny, I just wrote this morning about how Twitter forces us all into the most caricatured version of our views.;NY;
24844;buzz;@harryh I'm feeling very Frost/Nixon right now. https://t.co/GEd4b6PXY2;NY;
24845;buzz;@harryh Beyond that, I think we're going down the road to just equivocating about this for the rest of the day.;NY;
24846;buzz;@harryh If your life/business philosophy is that it's OK to cheat because regulation is inherently stupid/corrupt, I disagree.;NY;
24847;buzz;@harryh Obviously this is a less consequential example, but the reasoning is exactly the same.;NY;
24848;buzz;@harryh You know who else thinks rules are dumb? Companies that spew carcinogens into the air and maintain rusty oil pipelines.;NY;
24849;buzz;@harryh But that's not their decision to make.;NY;
24850;buzz;@harryh But yes, I will grant you that perhaps the direct connection to consumer harm is overstated.;NY;
24851;buzz;@harryh This was a case of actively conspiring to subvert the law.;NY;
24852;buzz;@harryh Once again, this was not a case of "Oops, we accidentally ran afoul of all that regulation again! What's an honest company to do?";NY;
24853;buzz;@harryh I would agree with that metaphor if, like, they had caught me modifying my speedometer or something.;NY;
24854;buzz;@timburks I used to be in that department and...I get the sense they're a bit strapped these days :-/.;NY;

54876;MartinBurnsSCO;@agileschools which illustrates nicely: you need multiple diagrams to show it clearly.;Scotland;
54877;MartinBurnsSCO;@joe_jag frameworks you'd encourage?;Scotland;
54878;MartinBurnsSCO;@agileschools @somesheep fractals are a pain to draw in a clear diagram. All diagrams simplify full reality to highlight some aspect;Edinburgh;
54879;MartinBurnsSCO;@writebeard French derivation rather than Anglo Saxon always upscales;Edinburgh;
54880;MartinBurnsSCO;@joe_jag would the latter ever be appropriate?;Edinburgh;
54882;MartinBurnsSCO;@jeffsussna @markusandrezak @ruthmalan @somesheep will you be here all week? Is there a dish we should try?;Edinburgh;
54883;MartinBurnsSCO;@ruthmalan @markusandrezak @somesheep and note my phrasing: OVERuse. Agree that use is useful.;Scotland;
54884;MartinBurnsSCO;@jeffsussna @markusandrezak @ruthmalan @somesheep https://t.co/hSf1yafHD1;Edinburgh;
54885;MartinBurnsSCO;@ruthmalan @markusandrezak @somesheep I see it being often used to insist "that's impossible" - discouraging learning;Edinburgh;
54886;MartinBurnsSCO;@markusandrezak @ruthmalan @somesheep @jeffsussna more worried that it's used to set up classes of acceptable thought.;Edinburgh;
54887;MartinBurnsSCO;@markusandrezak @ruthmalan @somesheep @jeffsussna worried that overuse of "oooh context" invalidates opportunities for learning.;Edinburgh;
54888;MartinBurnsSCO;@markusandrezak @ruthmalan @somesheep @jeffsussna been arguing that for some years now.;Edinburgh;
54890;MartinBurnsSCO;@garyfleming I think I had a pint of that when I was a student;Edinburgh;
54891;MartinBurnsSCO;@kevinrutherford bet you could do the job Really Well :-);Scotland;
54892;MartinBurnsSCO;@garyfleming :-). Note I'm happy with "generally" cos you rarely want to mess with eg safety rules for High Voltage installations;Scotland;
54893;MartinBurnsSCO;@garyfleming eg "we have an approach that's generally good enough. Are we going to spend weeks/months iterating or are we gonna JFDI?";Scotland;
54894;MartinBurnsSCO;@garyfleming to me anyway, BP is a starting point to save the time of wheel reinventing. Continuous improvement then generally takes over;Scotland;
54895;MartinBurnsSCO;@garyfleming which was my point: context is what you assume. Context free is a straw man.;Scotland;

67897;davidaxelrod;Probably fact that he is the most important black pol in SC also makes his proposal-or at least giving him a shoutout-desirable.#DemDebate;IL;
67898;davidaxelrod;Debate marred by violent agreement.#DemDebate;IL;
67899;davidaxelrod;"I'm not asking people to support me because I am a woman."What a difference a rough primary makes!#DemDebate;IL;
67900;davidaxelrod;Good bit of self-deprecation at the top of this women's answer for @HillaryClinton.#DemDebate;IL;
67901;davidaxelrod;But @sensanders continues to speak in values, while @HillaryClinton offers herself as truth-telling voice of what's achievable. #DemDebate;IL;
67902;davidaxelrod;And @SenSanders seems a bit weary.#DemDebate;IL;
67903;davidaxelrod;@HillaryClinton is far more effective in tone tonight, still on the attack without the edge of last week's NH donnybrook.#DemDebate;IL;
67904;davidaxelrod;On the other hand, will @realDonaldTrump finally get heightened scrutiny frontrunners generally receive?;IL;
67905;davidaxelrod;When this @GOP race broadens out to multiple states and becomes  an air war, won't @realDonaldTrump have edge due to his dominance of media?;IL;

80069;lacbc;Westwood &amp. Central say in Mobility Plan 2035! On to Council. #bikeLA #la2b;CA;
80071;lacbc;Planning Commission moves to adopt staff recommendation w/ minor language clarifications. Passes unanimously. #bikeLA #la2b;CA;
80073;lacbc;Com. Pres. Ambroz: Personally for bike lanes on Westwood, and opposed to stopping conversation. "Change is hard." #bikeLA #la2b;CA;
80075;lacbc;Com. Millman: "Complete Streets should bring our communities together." #bikeLA #la2b;CA;
80079;lacbc;Com. Perlman: People take direct route, not going to ride Gayley or Westholme as long as Westwood is faster. #bikeLA #la2b;CA;
80081;lacbc;Com. Perlman attributes #Westwood's lack of vibrancy due to limited multimodal accessibility. More options = better. #bikeLA #la2b;CA;
80083;lacbc;Com. Perlman: We did discuss this before. Plan is aspirational, predicates further analysis/engineering. Plan is foundation. #bikeLA #la2b;CA;
80085;lacbc;Com. Dake-Wilson: "We received over 100 comments re: bike lanes. Overwhelmingly in support." Thank YOU #bikeLA voices! #la2b;CA;
80087;lacbc;Com. Dake-Wilson: MP2035 already has responded to considerable community input. Wouldn't be right to change it at this point. #la2b;CA;

140999;mobivangelist;Woah. Apple PR is *tight* with the Groobs. https://t.co/mFfAQb9iIm;South Africa;
141001;mobivangelist;@RianVDM A lot of this debate treats poor users as having no agency. And that’s neither true, nor fair (nor liberal).;South Africa;
141002;mobivangelist;@RianVDM The win to users of retaining WhatsApp (FB!) access even without airtime is humongous and can’t be overstated.;South Africa;
141003;mobivangelist;@RianVDM My take is that (in SA at least) everybody wants to be on WhatsApp (FB!) but many are unreachable when they don’t have airtime.;South Africa;
141004;mobivangelist;@RianVDM The thing with “having” Internet us that it’s not the same as having airtime.;South Africa;
141005;mobivangelist;@RianVDM That’s not the issue (and I don’t think they were explicitly denying benefits to them). It’s about whether this hurts/harms users.;South Africa;
141006;mobivangelist;@RianVDM I also don’t buy the argument that poor folks would use a specific service *just* because it’s free.;South Africa;
141007;mobivangelist;@RianVDM But if they pay for full Internet, that’s win for the local operators.;South Africa;
141008;mobivangelist;@RianVDM 3) Neo-colonialism… that might be a little stretch. It feels more like the forces of capitalism at work.;South Africa;
141009;mobivangelist;@RianVDM 2) Framing this as a net neutrality thing is silly. I think stevesi nailed it when he said NN applies when you pay for your access.;South Africa;
141010;mobivangelist;@RianVDM Sjoe, so: 1) Facebook (long before pmarca) went about deploying Basics insensitively about context and that’s on them.;South Africa;
141011;mobivangelist;Only ever build something as a last resort. If initially it can be done manually, it should be done manually. “Do things that don’t scale.”;South Africa;
141012;mobivangelist;Non-technical founders sometimes have this idea of tech as a magical cure-all silver bullet with endless possibility. It’s not.;South Africa;
141013;mobivangelist;The irony is that it’s often not just the tech founders but also the non-tech founders that push for tech solutions to growth.;South Africa;
141014;mobivangelist;One of the biggest warning signs for a startup is if they try to solve bizdev with tech. It’s lazy and it doesn’t work.;South Africa;

143949;BootlegGirl;So out of curiosity (I probably won't go see it) what was the anti trans joke in Deadpool?;USA;
143951;BootlegGirl;But, obviously, I'll be a US citizen with a passport that says I'm female. and since I don't speak the language... passing might be easier;USA;
143952;BootlegGirl;Like, I know Finland has very discriminatory laws when it comes to transitioners who are Finnish. Apparently even name changes are hard.;USA;
143953;BootlegGirl;France and Finland are what I'm looking at. Maybe Germany instead of Finland though - I'm not 100% sure @danielzklein;USA;
143954;BootlegGirl;I'll have all my documentation in order that says as far as the US is concerned I'm a lady. But obviously there are still concerns.;USA;
143955;BootlegGirl;So, like, is there any particular level of transphobia I should expect, as a tourist in Europe?;USA;
143956;BootlegGirl;My mind-dad is still being like, "I remember when you were such a frugal child, what ever happened?";NJ;
143957;BootlegGirl;That's sort of what some of my issues with my father are like - my actual dad knows I'm taking a vacation to Europe and he approves.;NJ;
143958;BootlegGirl;Like, imagine if Kylo Ren had a version of Han Solo his mind created in his head that constanstly told him even ok things were bad.;NJ;
143959;BootlegGirl;is that I feel like I carry a version of my dad with me who is judging all my decisions critically. Comes from being homeschooled.;NJ;
143960;BootlegGirl;The thing I realized about the guilt issues I have with my dad - which I want to STRONGLY EMPHASIZE are not really his fault -;NJ;

158702;flhuxtable;In a free society, you own &amp. keep what you earn. Under socialism (or worse), you own nothing &amp. others own you: a slave to their needs.;FL;
158703;flhuxtable;Socialism (liberalism) is a doctrine of force, not freedom: it forces those who work to pay for those who don’t. #WakeUpAmerica;FL;
158704;flhuxtable;The right to life doesn’t mean you have a right to use government to live off of the backs of others. It’s your right to be free of others.;FL;
158705;flhuxtable;To conquer &amp. destroy a nation, you no longer need an invading army, only an invasion of illegal immigrants who will destroy from within.;FL;
158706;flhuxtable;Socialists (&amp. liberals) are in revolt against the American Revolution &amp. its founding principle of individual liberty. #WakeUpAmerica;FL;
158707;flhuxtable;Those who complain about money in politics are the first to ask you to vote for a government that will give you the money of others.;FL;
158708;flhuxtable;A Socialist (aka, liberal) doesn’t give away what he owns, but forces you to give away what you own. #WakeUpAmerica #Cashingin;FL;
158709;flhuxtable;Socialism is theft. It uses government to rob the money you earn to pay those who haven’t earned it: buying their vote with stolen money.;FL;
158710;flhuxtable;Government’s purpose is not to take your money to give others a free living, but to protect your freedom to earn a living. #WakeUpAmerica;FL;
158711;flhuxtable;In the last 100 years, socialist regimes (e.g., Nazi Germany) killed millions. Now, those ignorant of the past are rushing to repeat it.;FL;
158712;flhuxtable;There are makers &amp. takers. Those who don’t make, use government to take from those who do. @WakeUpAmerica #tcot;FL;
158713;flhuxtable;A socialist, leading in New Hampshire, is rewriting the state’s motto, “Live Free or Die,” to: “Live Free Off Others.”;FL;
158714;flhuxtable;In a free society you get what you earn. Under socialism, others get what you earn. #WakeUpAmerica;FL;
158715;flhuxtable;If America’s freedom is destroyed, it will be from an enemy within: our schools, which have now made socialism respectable. Look at Sanders.;FL;
158716;flhuxtable;Ominously, socialism is gaining favor in America. It’s a scheme to buy votes: it takes your money &amp. gives it to others for their vote.;FL;
158717;flhuxtable;As freedom has dwindled, the American Dream has faded: most know if you achieve it, you will be punished by regulations &amp. taxes.;FL;
158718;flhuxtable;Once it becomes known you do not lock the doors to your home, you will soon lose everything--even your life. The same is true of a nation.;FL;
158719;flhuxtable;The world’s showcase for income equality is N Korea where everyone, except for its rulers, are equal in their poverty. #WakeUpAmerica;FL;
158720;flhuxtable;Two questions for a presidential candidate: will you secure &amp. protect our borders—and—will you defend individual liberty?;FL;
158721;flhuxtable;Government has no money of its own.  If it gives you money, it’s money forcibly taken from someone else.;FL;

181910;djw2112;@PJStukas ... Ovi two more than Kane now ... Now there's the best sniper on the ice! Ovi over Crosby ...McDavid though ... Too early to tell;USA;
181911;djw2112;@PJStukas I think we all know that he's going to be around for a long time ... Pure natural talent. If Crosby wasn't a puss, he'd be ok;USA;
181912;djw2112;#FlyersTalk @JohnBorukCSN much better - don't like the thick stripes but it is a 100% improvement! Now you look like an analyst I can trust!;USA;
181913;djw2112;@TimRiday Are you for real? There is no comparison - two diff styles of play but you got to love the physical play of Gudas over MacD.;USA;
181914;djw2112;@PJStukas That's because Crosbaby is good but not great! All hype. As soon as league backed off ... His true skill showed he's not the best.;USA;
181915;djw2112;@TheOrangeUpdate did he have to hit him ... No, but that's part of the game and a big part of his game. Watch again, and again ... Not bad;USA;
181916;djw2112;@TheOrangeUpdate He had puck, he got hit. Stop pussifying the game. You never put your head down. It wasn't a hard hit. Looked worse.;USA;

181919;djw2112;@TheBSBPodcast @1221flyersfan looked bad because the kid dropped his head looking for the puck ... Oh well ... Never ever put your head down;USA;
181920;djw2112;@TheOrangeUpdate For what ... Head wasn't intended pt of conduct ...No intent to injure. Kid put his head down as he played w/puck. Oh well!;USA;
181921;djw2112;And the @NHL refs continue to pussify the league with crap calls like that. Head down, you own it. Get a grip @NHL! This is crap calling!;USA;
181922;djw2112;It never fails ... #Flyers have a good game and they call Gudas for a major charging? Five minutes ... Bullshit;USA;
181923;djw2112;Gudas gone for the night after a good hit and a fight. Head down, your gonna get hurt! Solid hit but they'll say intent to injure no doubt;USA;
181924;djw2112;@DStrehleTFP It's a shame he didn't have any support throughout the first half of the third! Looks sharp though - Four straight and counting;USA;

223878;taval;@dasniko @bennetelli @carstenlenz no, seriously, I think JEE has no decent answer to cloud ready deployments.;Deutschland;
223879;taval;@dasniko @bennetelli @carstenlenz and I thought the discussion was around whether to use JEE or not for mS :p;Deutschland;
223880;taval;@bennetelli @dasniko @carstenlenz at least they had to think when they drew the conclusion to use them!;Deutschland;
223881;taval;@bennetelli @dasniko @carstenlenz ... in the macro architect. Though such decisions belong rather to the micro architecture (in a mS world);Deutschland;
223882;taval;@bennetelli @dasniko @carstenlenz A key problem with JEE is that enterprise architects tend to carve the decision to use it in stone...;Deutschland;
223883;taval;@dasniko @bennetelli @carstenlenz is it still JEE then? If I don't use it, I can use JSE, right?;Deutschland;
223884;taval;@dasniko @bennetelli @carstenlenz true, but if you are particularly targeting Microservices, there is a lot in JEE that you don't need.;Deutschland;
223885;taval;@dasniko @carstenlenz ... But I should have add a smiley to my tweet before.;Deutschland;

232107;markcallaghan;How do #MyRocks and @RocksDB do on sysbench versus InnoDB?https://t.co/wDElVjKapL;CA;
232108;markcallaghan;@united Please add one more question, least favorite frequent flyer web site. Answer is easy right now.;CA;
232109;markcallaghan;@united please rethink "MileagePlus account security enhancements". Obscure questions with pre-selected answers == won't remember;CA;
232110;markcallaghan;@xaprb I just want to save a piece of the pie for people who do perf debugging. So much slogging (like installing TokuDB), need some pie.;CA;
232111;markcallaghan;@VividCortex It shows that it does, it doesn't explain why it does. You give it too much credit with "reveals all".;CA;
232112;markcallaghan;@h_ingo @RocksDB But difference between MongoDB and MySQL much larger than between Mongo/WT &amp. Mongo/Rocks. That is the big story.;OR;
232113;markcallaghan;@h_ingo @RocksDB Don't know yet. @igorcanadi and I will figure it out;CA;
232114;markcallaghan;#myrocks vs the world, loads faster &amp. more efficient, thanks @RocksDB https://t.co/WHMXGAbbxw;CA;
232116;markcallaghan;@webmink @h_ingo Like the authors I am disappointed by the failure of ASF to IPO. So much potential.;CA;
232117;markcallaghan;@kastauyra Looking forward to setting all of these new memory allocation config variables for PFS? https://t.co/DPTswzBOoT;CA;
232118;markcallaghan;@h_ingo Why start with an insult?"It’s no secret that open-source technology — once the province of radicals, hippies and granola eaters";CA;
232121;markcallaghan;@MicrosoftHelps New red text on web page, maybe someone noticed it really is a bug https://t.co/CAYdGq1mP1;CA;
232122;markcallaghan;@dimitrik_fr @MySQL Plan is to use it when we move to 5.8. Might skip 5.7.;CA;
232123;markcallaghan;@dimitrik_fr @MySQL I look forward to more robust PFS, no longer willing to do QA for it.;CA;
232124;markcallaghan;@dimitrik_fr @MySQL Many problems with PFS, not just CPU overhead. See also memory overhead bugs.;CA;
232125;markcallaghan;@dimitrik_fr @MySQL Prefer that upstream spends time on finding and reducing overheads from PFS, rather than disable it during perf tests;CA;
232126;markcallaghan;@dimitrik_fr @MySQL disabling features everyone uses inflates QPS. Smells like benchmarketing to me.;CA;

239216;QvortrupHenrik;Carsten Jensen kritiserer "inkriminerende retorik", men ønsker nazitegning gjort officiel. Dobbeltmoral spiddet her: https://t.co/13tqauTIdO;Danmark;
239217;QvortrupHenrik;Min gode ven Gustav har haft en af de bedre dage. https://t.co/cq1PKxkSfl;Danmark;
239226;QvortrupHenrik;@benzon1960 Jeg har faktisk lige interviewet 92-årige Arne Melchior. Kommer på DK4 en af de kommende uger.;Danmark;
239227;QvortrupHenrik;@sorenpind @mariannejelved @radikale Nu drømmer du virkelig, Søren;Danmark;
239228;QvortrupHenrik;.@mariannejelved om EU's fiasko med at håndtere flygtningekrise.: "Vi mangler Kohl og Mitterand". @radikale #dkpol https://t.co/9X8K2ziYK0;Danmark;
239295;DigitizeSociety;@JMchangama @P1radio Hårdt arbejde ligesom at få konstruktiv dialog m #faktaresistent #dkpol Efterspørg gerne holistisk analyse af #logning!;Danmark;
239296;DigitizeSociety;@ChristinaEgelun @HKjaer @BrianMikkelsenC @sorenpind Helt enig! Så diskussionen er om man skal bruge 1mia på nytteløs logning el flere folk?;Danmark;
239298;DigitizeSociety;@je5perl @HKjaer @BrianMikkelsenC @jakobwiller Ser hellere at samfundet bruger 1mia på flere folk #SkægOgBlåBriller end på nytteløs logning!;Danmark;
239299;DigitizeSociety;@je5perl @PernilleT Når Skype el Facebook Messenger bruges er det P2P hvorfor der r et IP-IP spor. naturligvis kan IP i begge ender spoofes.;Danmark;
239301;DigitizeSociety;@Bjarkealling @bjornborre ???? skulle have været million ... men konverteret til DKK ville det svare til 2,75 mia. ...;Danmark;
239302;DigitizeSociety;@Bjarkealling @bjornborre Obama: 1/2 milliard per borger på #cybersikkerhed/#folkeoplysning. #dkpol lader os forarme digitalt! #dkbiz #itpol;Danmark;
239303;DigitizeSociety;#dkpol &amp. #DK politicians! Do as Obama @POTUS: Massively fund #cybersecurity &amp. #citizenawareness w/$19B ~ 133B DKK! https://t.co/nJU31uYZ12;Danmark;
239305;DigitizeSociety;@je5perl Om man fjerner 1 nul eller 2, ændrer ikke min pointe… det må være muligt at løse. vi øger "overvågning" men letter efterforskning…;Danmark;
239306;DigitizeSociety;@je5perl Vi kan ikke tilrettelægge samfundet m udgangspunkt i de 0.0001% som måske vil have en udfordring fx må kommunerne hjælpe hjemløse.;Danmark;
239307;DigitizeSociety;@je5perl Forestiller mig en digital løsning som skanner telekort (SIM-id) og stregkode i pas lidt ala DSB ID app/Easyjet skanner -&gt. gir OTP.;Danmark;
239308;DigitizeSociety;@je5perl Måske kan butikkerne issue et ID-OTP ved fremvisning af pasnr/id+navn/land (turister/illegale) &amp. sygesikring (for hjemløse)?;Danmark;
239309;DigitizeSociety;@je5perl Jesper, uenig: Taletidskort skal alle sammen autoriseres via NemID for at kunne sikre et minimum af sporbarhed &amp. sidestilles m abn.;Danmark;
239310;DigitizeSociety;@sorenpind Forstår nødvendighed af at #politidk får de rette værktøjer men det ik #sessionslogning! Giv 1 mia til præemptiv manpower… #dkpol;Danmark;
239311;DigitizeSociety;Ærgeligt at en OK oplevelse hos @SixtDK forpurres af uvidenhed både i callcenter &amp. onsite om gældende policy… Aldrig oplevet som HertzGold!;Danmark;
239313;DigitizeSociety;@sorenpind @je5perl @tv2newsdk Er vel et plaster på såret, når branchen i 06 anslog 500,0 mio. &amp. nu 1.000,0 mio. Kun borgerne til at betale?;Danmark;
239314;DigitizeSociety;@je5perl Findes der tal for DK ? Vi estimerede omk til ca. 500 mio for 06-13 ... i UK ville det så være ca £500mio (3x UK budget)?;Danmark;
