63;Ocramius;@kalessil `require 'filename.php'` - no vars, constant value, no __DIR__, non-absolute path;Deutschland;
64;Ocramius;@harikt that is a separate concern. Any API backend can "forget" the validator (bug) /cc @xtreamwayz @dantleech @Sulu_io;Deutschland;
65;Ocramius;@harikt could you elaborate on "easy to guess the input"? This component extracts a validator from XML/HTML @xtreamwayz @dantleech @Sulu_io;Deutschland;
66;Ocramius;.@kalessil one suggestion for EA inspections: mark includes without an absolute constant path (they would hit include_path) /cc @phpstorm;Deutschland;
67;Ocramius;@matthieunapoli a wrapper usually wraps around public API to fake something. As soon as a method is inherited, that is broken;Deutschland;
68;Ocramius;"Ah, it's in French... So that's why it doesn't exist...";Deutschland;

2333;ceejbot;Hmm, if you were going to JSConf Iceland, what would you want to hear about? Mulling over writing talk proposal!;CA;
2337;izs;@DeirdreS oh for sure. I think radicalism kinda requires giving a lot of a certain kind of fuck tho.;CA;
2338;izs;This is the first time someone is near to being on the ballot who actually seems to have "don't kill people" as a priority. So I'm excited.;CA;
2339;izs;Basically, every four years, I try to vote for whichever sociopath will use the most powerful weapons in history to kill the fewest people.;CA;
2340;izs;@goofbone oh lol, didn't realize you were chiming in, took it as a debate sry my bad :);CA;
2341;izs;The flip side, Feminister Than Thou, is also hella tedious though. There are good reasons many young feminists prefer Bernie.;CA;
2342;izs;And, yeah, the Great White Liberal Educator complex is real and annoying. There are reasons some smart well-informed folks prefer Hillary.;CA;
2343;izs;@goofbone I did. And I'm convinced that Hillary and Bernie will be identical in their view on that. So no point discussing.;CA;
2344;izs;Meanwhile, HRC is all "all lives matter" and afaik still has not really addressed police violence except to change the subject to terrorism.;CA;
2345;izs;And, let's not forget, Bernie got heckled to shit by BLM, and *actually addressed the issue*, which is sadly pretty much unheard of;CA;
2346;izs;@scripterson @mikeal @dominictarr No.;CA;
2347;izs;All things being equal? Yeah, I think it's high time for a woman president.But the things, they ain't equal.;CA;
2348;izs;Only Bernie has made spoken out about free education, wealth disparity, and health care a core part of his platform.;CA;
2349;izs;Only Bernie has said he's going to actively reduce the footprint of the American military empire.;CA;
2350;izs;Both Bernie and Hillary will fight for health care, lgbt rights, and the basic "table stakes" progressivism.  So what?;CA;
2351;izs;It's great HRC is experienced, can "get stuff done". But does that "stuff" involve reducing the number of people killed by the US? Doubtful.;CA;
2352;izs;Here's the thing: I am a single issue voter. My single issue is that the govt should help people, not kill them. https://t.co/MwdNXIqBIn;CA;
2353;izs;@DeirdreS I don't know that that's really borne out by evidence. Yes, women get shit on more as they age, but more radical? Doesn't seem so.;CA;
