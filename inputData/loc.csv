864;wilshipley;@culturestate That. Would. Make. Me. Batshit. Insane.;CA
865;wilshipley;For those keeping score, I’ve had to log into my iPhone five times today because of Apple’s bullshit iCloud security scare.;CA
866;wilshipley;@codinghorror @isaiah I do too!;CA
869;wilshipley;Can I help you with something? -nobody, ever, at Rainbow Grocery;CA
870;wilshipley;@Nahirk @mahalis I believe it’s an Adobe AIR product? It really does suck donkey balls.;CA
871;wilshipley;@fostermatt @gte There’s no timer on games!;CA
872;wilshipley;@Enzo90910 Rangers kind of rule. I think it’s cool they’re NO GOOD against Mutons, though. Keeps it fair.;CA
873;wilshipley;@macprince Well, doesn’t that joke trump.;CA
874;wilshipley;@raruler I haven’t traveled yet. Still the same routine. Work at home, go one mile to café.;CA
875;wilshipley;If this really WAS for “security reasons” and something happened in the last hour, how about TELLING ME what happened? That’d be good.;CA
876;wilshipley;This crap from iCloud is unacceptable. You can’t just disable people’s accounts randomly, Apple. :( https://t.co/jwdJw8sWcX;CA
877;wilshipley;The best part is the guy had a Frenchie puppy in that bag. https://t.co/lA7UtHlxQL;CA
878;wilshipley;@jessicaspacekat Head trauma is a serious thing. It’s time we start a convoy-sation about it.;CA
879;wilshipley;@clattner_llvm “Swift for wusses,” you mean. I scoff at them. Scoff scoff!;CA
880;wilshipley;@RebeccaSlatkin I sing, “Clean as you go, clean as you go, everybody clean as you go.”;CA

2320;ceejbot;Well looks like somebody has an opinion about my attempts to work. https://t.co/95u1396i99;CA
2321;ceejbot;I am very excite about the topic, but dammit, when do I get to not work?;CA
2322;ceejbot;I need to write this presentation for tomorrow tonight, since I had no time to do it all day. I might just bail. On my own tech deep dive.;CA
2326;ceejbot;Current status: #argent film simulator, plus some fun reading https://t.co/3hwqthrTOc;CA
2327;ceejbot;@quephird I can recommend a pen &amp. ink dealer if you need a supply :P :P;CA

2331;ceejbot;Surprised to observe that this was not @TlfTravelAlerts https://t.co/Ztvsle1jnb;CA
2333;ceejbot;Hmm, if you were going to JSConf Iceland, what would you want to hear about? Mulling over writing talk proposal!;CA
2337;izs;@DeirdreS oh for sure. I think radicalism kinda requires giving a lot of a certain kind of fuck tho.;CA
2338;izs;"This is the first time someone is near to being on the ballot who actually seems to have ""don't kill people"" as a priority. So I'm excited.";CA
2339;izs;Basically, every four years, I try to vote for whichever sociopath will use the most powerful weapons in history to kill the fewest people.;CA
2340;izs;@goofbone oh lol, didn't realize you were chiming in, took it as a debate sry my bad :);CA
2341;izs;The flip side, Feminister Than Thou, is also hella tedious though. There are good reasons many young feminists prefer Bernie.;CA
2342;izs;And, yeah, the Great White Liberal Educator complex is real and annoying. There are reasons some smart well-informed folks prefer Hillary.;CA
2343;izs;@goofbone I did. And I'm convinced that Hillary and Bernie will be identical in their view on that. So no point discussing.;CA
2344;izs;"Meanwhile, HRC is all ""all lives matter"" and afaik still has not really addressed police violence except to change the subject to terrorism.";CA
2345;izs;And, let's not forget, Bernie got heckled to shit by BLM, and *actually addressed the issue*, which is sadly pretty much unheard of;CA
2346;izs;@scripterson @mikeal @dominictarr No.;CA
2347;izs;All things being equal? Yeah, I think it's high time for a woman president.But the things, they ain't equal.;CA
2348;izs;Only Bernie has made spoken out about free education, wealth disparity, and health care a core part of his platform.;CA
2349;izs;Only Bernie has said he's going to actively reduce the footprint of the American military empire.;CA
2350;izs;"Both Bernie and Hillary will fight for health care, lgbt rights, and the basic ""table stakes"" progressivism.  So what?";CA
2351;izs;"It's great HRC is experienced, can ""get stuff done"". But does that ""stuff"" involve reducing the number of people killed by the US? Doubtful.";CA
2352;izs;Here's the thing: I am a single issue voter. My single issue is that the govt should help people, not kill them. https://t.co/MwdNXIqBIn;CA
2353;izs;@DeirdreS I don't know that that's really borne out by evidence. Yes, women get shit on more as they age, but more radical? Doesn't seem so.;CA
2356;izs;@izs everyone's happy… kinda. Curious and apprehensive. Wondering if this is a good idea, fighting the urge to back out.;CA

3639;bcantrill;@Dymaxion @nickstenning @postwait Fine -- it just makes you more a polemicist than an engineer.;CA
3904;izs;@quackingduck most killers couch their actions in justifications. But yah, they kinda DO just decide to start killing. Qv the Middle East;CA
3907;izs;.@quackingduck and yet, they go out killing whole new bunches of people. Whatever they thought, their priorities in action are clear.;CA
3908;izs;@DeirdreS likely! Badasses tend to seek one another out. I suspect badassery may increase with age. Doubtful that political radicalism does.;CA

228340;BeanyYH;super annoyed by some vendor. Seriously!!!!!!!!!! Don't you ever claim one thing if you can never do it right (furious);CA

232124;markcallaghan;@dimitrik_fr @MySQL Many problems with PFS, not just CPU overhead. See also memory overhead bugs.;CA
232125;markcallaghan;@dimitrik_fr @MySQL Prefer that upstream spends time on finding and reducing overheads from PFS, rather than disable it during perf tests;CA
232126;markcallaghan;@dimitrik_fr @MySQL disabling features everyone uses inflates QPS. Smells like benchmarketing to me.;CA

1104986;SaintsRearview;I think Ben Carson is only still in the race, so that Donald Trump and Marco Rubio can use him to criticize Ted Cruz. #GOPDebate;TX
1104987;SaintsRearview;Cruz has criticized the Bush family extensively, and even George W has said he doesn't like Cruz. #GOPDebate https://t.co/vH8kjStDTG;TX
1104988;SaintsRearview;@Barnes96 I think Jeb Bush's criticisms of Donald Trump are mostly valid. But Trump's criticisms of Ted Cruz are valid, too. #GOPDebate;TX
1104991;SaintsRearview;@Barnes96 I don't think Rubio fazed Trump that much. Jeb got 70% of his vitriol, Cruz 20%, and former POTUS George W Bush got 10. #GOPDebate;TX

1802246;mikermcneil;@bradleymeck @izs Ah, gotcha.  That'd be a helpful step anyway-- like  `$(document).ready()` for any promise.;TX
1802247;mikermcneil;@bradleymeck @izs coming up against is that this kind of evaluator fn needs a common interface for operators (or can use only builtins eg +);TX
1802248;mikermcneil;"@bradleymeck @izs think so-- you'd need the ""or value depending"" recursively though, right?  Like `${a|83.4} + ${b|4}`. I guess what we're..";TX
1802249;mikermcneil;@izs you usually want the _whole expr_ to collapse into some kind of catchall err (and if not, you'd have to be more explicit regardless).;TX
1802250;mikermcneil;@izs i.e. composed of literals and not-yet-computed data (whether it's async or not). But if even one of those promises is broken, then...;TX
1802251;mikermcneil;"@izs we need something higher level. at least in my experience, in order to be useful these ""eventual values"" need to be composite.";TX
1802252;mikermcneil;@izs an API that's more like an expression builder? Sort of like `_.template()`, but for JSON-serializable data instead of HTML. It seems...;TX

158702;flhuxtable;In a free society, you own &amp. keep what you earn. Under socialism (or worse), you own nothing &amp. others own you: a slave to their needs.;FL
158703;flhuxtable;Socialism (liberalism) is a doctrine of force, not freedom: it forces those who work to pay for those who don’t. #WakeUpAmerica;FL
158704;flhuxtable;The right to life doesn’t mean you have a right to use government to live off of the backs of others. It’s your right to be free of others.;FL
158705;flhuxtable;To conquer &amp. destroy a nation, you no longer need an invading army, only an invasion of illegal immigrants who will destroy from within.;FL
158706;flhuxtable;Socialists (&amp. liberals) are in revolt against the American Revolution &amp. its founding principle of individual liberty. #WakeUpAmerica;FL
158707;flhuxtable;Those who complain about money in politics are the first to ask you to vote for a government that will give you the money of others.;FL
158708;flhuxtable;A Socialist (aka, liberal) doesn’t give away what he owns, but forces you to give away what you own. #WakeUpAmerica #Cashingin;FL
158709;flhuxtable;Socialism is theft. It uses government to rob the money you earn to pay those who haven’t earned it: buying their vote with stolen money.;FL
158710;flhuxtable;Government’s purpose is not to take your money to give others a free living, but to protect your freedom to earn a living. #WakeUpAmerica;FL
158711;flhuxtable;In the last 100 years, socialist regimes (e.g., Nazi Germany) killed millions. Now, those ignorant of the past are rushing to repeat it.;FL
158712;flhuxtable;There are makers &amp. takers. Those who don’t make, use government to take from those who do. @WakeUpAmerica #tcot;FL
158713;flhuxtable;A socialist, leading in New Hampshire, is rewriting the state’s motto, “Live Free or Die,” to: “Live Free Off Others.”;FL
158714;flhuxtable;In a free society you get what you earn. Under socialism, others get what you earn. #WakeUpAmerica;FL
158715;flhuxtable;If America’s freedom is destroyed, it will be from an enemy within: our schools, which have now made socialism respectable. Look at Sanders.;FL
158716;flhuxtable;Ominously, socialism is gaining favor in America. It’s a scheme to buy votes: it takes your money &amp. gives it to others for their vote.;FL
158717;flhuxtable;As freedom has dwindled, the American Dream has faded: most know if you achieve it, you will be punished by regulations &amp. taxes.;FL
158718;flhuxtable;Once it becomes known you do not lock the doors to your home, you will soon lose everything--even your life. The same is true of a nation.;FL
158719;flhuxtable;The world’s showcase for income equality is N Korea where everyone, except for its rulers, are equal in their poverty. #WakeUpAmerica;FL
158720;flhuxtable;Two questions for a presidential candidate: will you secure &amp. protect our borders—and—will you defend individual liberty?;FL
158721;flhuxtable;Government has no money of its own.  If it gives you money, it’s money forcibly taken from someone else.;FL

20987;mountaineerdave;@jledbetter @WIRED First, foremost end the lost ‘war on drugs’ and release its non-violent victims from prison.;MA
20988;mountaineerdave;Up is such a strange album. Because of the conversion to a band of 3, it is so aurally interesting to me.;MA
20989;mountaineerdave;No one asked but since @hotdogsladies &amp. @siracusa mention it: Fables, Murmur, and either Green, Out of Time, or Up.;MA
20990;mountaineerdave;Had a laugh when @siracusa named the 1st 3 Warner Bros albums as a ‘hellava run’ before ‘selling out!’;MA
20991;mountaineerdave;Reckoning, @hotdogsladies ? I’m always surprised when folks choose that as their favorite REM album.;MA
20995;mountaineerdave;Lovely. @realDonaldTrump romped with the dumbest in New Hampshire. That feels meaningful.;MA
20998;mountaineerdave;I love when buccigross drops the Driver 8 reference. I know I’m not alone but I feel like that’s just for me.;MA
21001;mountaineerdave;Good lord, where have I been?;MA
21002;mountaineerdave;My favorite thing about what refs did with this Carter-Maston thing is that they quickly moved to avoid a fight. #WVUvBay;MA
21003;mountaineerdave;West Virginia is playing pretty damn well right now. Not quite the way they did that first 17? against UVA (fave of season I saw) but great;MA
21004;mountaineerdave;@pattonoswalt what’s?! They don’t become understanding and accepting of carpet bombing?! Shocking.;MA
21005;mountaineerdave;Sometimes, the next comic in the stack is too heavy or attention-needed for my mood, and I have to read something else.;MA
21006;mountaineerdave;Yeah. The plow comes AFTER I dig out the driveway. Dick.;MA

1982528;SusanPotter;@goodwillbits might be a while Gisting.;IL
1982530;SusanPotter;@goodwillbits If so, then I think the reason for that style is not well documented or articulated. Let me take a stab at it though.;IL
1982532;SusanPotter;@goodwillbits I just woke up from nap and I wonder if the single letter type vars or function args are part of the terseness factor for you?;IL
1982534;SusanPotter;@goodwillbits @iElectric I don't see it as such so I'd be curious what you find terse. I find it minimal &amp. whitespace padded but not terse.;IL
1982536;SusanPotter;@goodwillbits @iElectric We can explore question of whether mathematical thinking is relevant to programming to separate concerns. :);IL
1982538;SusanPotter;@goodwillbits @iElectric I might reframe problem as: imperative programmers (myself once incl.) find current teaching materials inadequate.;IL
1982540;SusanPotter;@goodwillbits @iElectric again, what kind of n00bs? What background did they have? How did you introduce material? ... so many factors.;IL
1982542;SusanPotter;"@goodwillbits @iElectric what is the problem though? Without meaningful articulation of the problem discussion of ""solutions"" isn't useful.";IL
1982544;SusanPotter;@goodwillbits @iElectric and I would much rather read Haskell or Idris than Python. I can reason about those. Not Python.;IL
1982546;SusanPotter;@goodwillbits @iElectric I can produce as many opinion pieces as you on the other side. The post is an opinion. A barrier to what though?;IL
1982548;SusanPotter;@goodwillbits @iElectric mathematical notation is simply precise &amp. unambiguous. Some skill is required to read it just like music notation.;IL
1982550;SusanPotter;@goodwillbits @iElectric couldn't disagree more. Centuries of mathematicians disagree too, unless you mean they aren't human? :);IL
1982552;SusanPotter;@goodwillbits @iElectric I also don't agree that it is terse. It is just more math like.;IL
1982554;SusanPotter;@goodwillbits @iElectric I don't know anyone tauts terseness as a pro. I see RT by default, call by need, typesafety potential, etc as pros.;IL
1982556;SusanPotter;@btbytes we now have a nixos pool of jenkins workers we use to run nix-shell shebag'd CI scripts for services.;IL
1982557;SusanPotter;@btbytes app devs were too used to Jenkins to put their internal services CI into Hydea. :(;IL
1982559;SusanPotter;"My dad used to call it ""the gazinter"". Not sure where that came from. https://t.co/AvGyCPoxZh";IL
1982561;SusanPotter;@btbytes we do NOT fork nixpkgs though. It's a totally separate channel we use in addition to nixpkgs. I think this decision saved us time.;IL
1982563;SusanPotter;@btbytes Nix channel, yes. We have a bin cache we manage based on machine image paths active. Hydra was fine for pkg CI but not services CI.;IL

2246117;BrandonLive;@FishFaceMcGee Other reason to build your own is you save space (and memory + startup cost) by not including things you don't use.;WA
2246118;BrandonLive;@FishFaceMcGee Yeah I haven't used Angular myself so can't comment on how that would work. Knockout seems like it'd be a natural combo tho.;WA
2246119;BrandonLive;@FishFaceMcGee Yeah that's all I use in Tweetium. 4.4 is good, but I submitted a PR to them to fix color emojis, they took it last week.;WA

2246122;BrandonLive;@FishFaceMcGee Also has some good styles in their CSS. WinJS.Utilities has jQuery-like basics, but I could see using jQuery too.;WA
2246123;BrandonLive;@FishFaceMcGee The data-binding and templating stuff is decent, similar to Knockout but not as concise and flexible. Unsure what I'd use now;WA
2246124;BrandonLive;@FishFaceMcGee WinJS has a lot of great controls and good helpers for app-specific stuff (like the Application object) for WinRT/UWP apps.;WA
2246125;BrandonLive;@FishFaceMcGee Ah, I haven't looked into that, I just knew they had some integrations for those.;WA

2936866;coreyholms;@mrwarren So awesome! @panic;WA
2936867;coreyholms;Blackbox Recorder’s “England Made Me” is probably the sweetest musically and darkest lyrically album I know. Can’t recommend it enough.;WA
2936869;coreyholms;@naterblow Mine was always something perfect for one specific instance, which I wouldn’t write down inexplicably.;WA
2936870;coreyholms;@faketimkim Hahahaha. I’m still paying mine, and just sent my daughter into the same thing. Sigh.;WA
2936871;coreyholms;@MCPlace see, you’re thinking!;WA
2936872;coreyholms;@faketimkim Although altruism genuinely exists, it’s rare as hen’s teeth.;WA
2936873;coreyholms;@faketimkim And outside of getting the drop on the best students to work for your company, there must be more incentive.;WA
2936874;coreyholms;@naterblow I used to have a drawer full of scraps of paper with typeface names written on them. Don’t know why I wanted to remember them.;WA
2936875;coreyholms;@faketimkim Hahahaha. Point taken.;WA
2936876;coreyholms;@faketimkim So you get a self selecting group that go into education.;WA
2936877;coreyholms;@faketimkim I think part of the problem may be that if you succeed at design business, you make more than you would as a teacher.;WA
2936878;coreyholms;@faketimkim No, you cannot teach motivation or passion. It’s like teaching someone to be a self starter, I don’t think it can happen.;WA
2936879;coreyholms;@faketimkim I don’t know where I’m going with this anymore… sorry, lost my head of steam.;WA
2936880;coreyholms;@faketimkim I just feel that the balance is off. The grads get served well because that’s what the teachers like to spend time on.;WA
2936881;coreyholms;@faketimkim Thanks to those people, I had a waived tuition one year. I am in debt to people with little interest in college &amp. rich parents.;WA
2936882;coreyholms;@faketimkim And yes, there will always be students who go to art school because their parents pay for them to.;WA
2936883;coreyholms;@naterblow Hahaha. More that I have the brain of a gold fish and won’t remember tomorrow.;WA
2936884;coreyholms;@faketimkim A school’s reputation should be judged by how successful they are. Paul Rand would have done well regardless of the school.;WA
2936885;coreyholms;@faketimkim The two different types of students are often taught by the same teachers.;WA

2110508;TheM_L_G;@benjaminpugsley @LeutrimRexhaj yeah, and today a good example of how hard it gets. Played well, best team, no points. Outa room for those.;DC
2110509;TheM_L_G;@LeutrimRexhaj all youre doing is saying here's a reason City might get better. Sure they might be! That's really only part of the equation.;DC
2110510;TheM_L_G;@LeutrimRexhaj could just as easily say it doesn't account for Leicester not being burdened with Europe for example.;DC
2110511;TheM_L_G;@LeutrimRexhaj it does in that assuming that everybody comes back and stays healthy is only part of the possible outcomes left.;DC
2110512;TheM_L_G;@LeutrimRexhaj and yet projection models built on xG have their title chances under 10%. So...;DC
2110513;TheM_L_G;@CityAcrossPond sure. People don't actually think about how likely the outcome is, just do I think the team is better or worse.;DC
2110514;TheM_L_G;@ETNAR_uk @Soccermetric heh, if it happens it sure won't be the first or last thing I've been wrong about.;DC
2110515;TheM_L_G;@LeutrimRexhaj it's true, City have to pass three teams and United only have to pass one.;DC
2110516;TheM_L_G;Perceptions funny. No one said boo when I called Uniteds CL chances done. 6 back in 5th. Pushback on City's title chance tho. 6 back in 4th.;DC

3368221;JohnBorghi;"@lore_nick @mark_siberdog57 Yikes! Thanks for pointing that out! I totally meant to say ""microbes"". I blame conference fatigue.";DC
3368222;JohnBorghi;Even though @radiolab and @BoldSignalsPod live on opposite ends of the iTunes charts, they collided at the #AAASmtg. https://t.co/St0yUa4TX3;DC
3368223;JohnBorghi;@SmithDanaG @scicurious Yes! I had the same thought. I believe this has even been discussed at a couple conference sessions.;DC
3368224;JohnBorghi;Instead of communicating science as a compendium of things we know, @JadAbumrad thinks we should focus on what we don't. #AAASmtg;DC
3368225;JohnBorghi;Science communication is about communicating discovery to the person across the table. -@JadAbumrad at #AAASmtg;DC
3368226;JohnBorghi;The goal of #scicomm is not to be precise (though you should be) or say how much you know (though you should know). -@JadAbumrad at #AAASmtg;DC

3368234;JohnBorghi;@BenLillie For sure. I think it'll come down to changing the perception that scientists and non-scientists are wholly separate groups.;DC
3368235;JohnBorghi;@BenLillie Which, to be fair, doesn't seem to be an uncommon sentiment here at the #AAASmtg.;DC
3368236;JohnBorghi;@BenLillie I've been thinking that #scicomm needs less focus on teaching non-scientists science and more teaching scientists communication.;DC

914214;adambyram;@ViNull Doesn’t Food City do that? I seem to remember hearing @WhimSQL talk/tweet about it a while back.;TN
914215;adambyram;@cph79 If only the Apple Store had a fix for that. :);TN
914216;adambyram;@Bwech Looks like the code was forked so I can still grab it. I’ll try tonight and see if it works. Curious how it can do it if Apple can’t.;TN
914217;adambyram;@cph79 Yeah, I don’t think there is a clear winner yet.;TN
914218;adambyram;@Bwech Apparently. I’m kinda curious why that isn’t backwards compatible.;TN
914219;adambyram;@cph79 I watch CamelCamelCamel for price drops on things like that and buy when it’s a good deal. Looks like it got to $30 last year.;TN
914220;adambyram;@cph79 You’re right - I thought we got it cheaper. I paid $38 shipped from Amazon. https://t.co/csRUn5OTVw;TN
914221;adambyram;@cph79 Yeah, that’s why we just have one $20 switch + got the Echo really cheap. No way we’re going to automate the whole house anytime soon;TN
914222;adambyram;Really excited about the Night Shift feature of iOS 9.3. Opted my iPad 3 into the beta only to discover Night Shift isn’t compatible. :(;TN
914223;adambyram;@cph79 We actually use our Echo so much that we thought our daughter knows “who” Alexa is now and looks up to our mantle when she hears it.;TN
914224;adambyram;@cph79 The cool thing is, it actually works. I’ve had a WeMo hooked up to our Echo since they rolled out that feature and it’s great.;TN
914225;adambyram;Sweet. Firewatch purchased and preloaded. Can’t wait @camposanto @panic - looks excellent!;TN
914227;adambyram;I have rarely had any type of motion sickness in my Rift DK1, but yeah, Cardboard apps (tried several) are much worse for me.;TN
914228;adambyram;I don’t know if it’s wrong IPD, lower framerate, and/or worse positional tracking, but Google Cardboard is much more nauseating vs Rift DK1.;TN
914229;adambyram;@le_bon_voyageur Yep. It was on sale for $18 on Amazon, so thought I’d give it a try to compare with my Oculus.;TN
914230;adambyram;Resolution wise, it actually looks as good as my Rift DK1 (but with maybe half the field of view).;TN

2858196;NashSportsEd;The #NHLAllStar Game down to final 10 minutes. Atlantic/Pacific tied 0-0. Best script sends this to shootout with John Scott with winner.;TN
2858197;NashSportsEd;You can tell there's $1 million on line in #NHLAllStar final game. Atlantic, Pacific players appear to be tad more serious in finale.;TN

4485518;pinkbunny70;@Obama4More @elyse4design Bu the way economic growth was due to boom coming out of WWII, and increased public spending.;VA
